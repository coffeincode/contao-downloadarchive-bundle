This extension allows to organize downloads in archives, similar to news archives. It's a fork/port of laemmi/contao-downloadarchive which ported the original Downloadarchive by felixpfeiffer/contao-downloadarchive. 
Credit goes to laemmi & felixpfeiffer, as the concept is not my work  - I only ported it to Contao 5.3 and moved it to using twig and as much symfony as possible. 

This extension is my test for coding in Contao 5.3. Most things work, all database-fields have been preserved so it should be compatible in case you upgrade from Contao 4.x and are in need for a Contao 5.3-version. 
Be aware that this extension makes full use of twig-templates. If unsure overwrite the whole template.
